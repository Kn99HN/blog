Welcome to Burn Rate, TORCH's new blog!

TORCH is an incubator for NYU's tech community. Our goal is to foster
an environment where students can further their career ambitions as
well as their technical skills. We aim to accomplish this goal through
fun activities, workshops and networking with the vast array of
companies located in New York.

This blog is a space for us to write articles on anything; from an
introduction to TypeScript to a guide on surviving NYU's hardest CS
class, to starting one's career and the technical interview.

We hope you enjoy!
