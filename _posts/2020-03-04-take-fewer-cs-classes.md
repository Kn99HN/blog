title:  "Take Fewer CS Classes"

I like programming. I spend a lot of my days thinking, reading and
writing about programming and computer science. Until this semester, I
had not taken more than one CS class per semester. Why?

# (Don't) Burn Out

I believe it's very important to not burn out. If you're
passionate about CS like I am, you spend a lot of time on it
already. Add on classes and the sheer quantity of work can easily
overwhelm your life. Therefore I find it absolutely essential to carve
out time for other activities and interests. One issue that people may
not anticipate is that if your hobby becomes your main study and
eventually your profession, you can end up spending entire days solely
on this interest. Which may sound great at first, but working on
something for 12 hours a day, every day can wear you down.

This sort of extreme monotasking can sneak up on you in college. A lot
of us did various extracurriculars in high school like sports,
theater, various clubs, etc., but quit these activities in
college. You can easily go from a well rounded, active person to
someone solely studying their major. I'd highly recommend finding
other activities to do. And no, drinking/partying/clubbing doesn't
count.

# Diversify Yo' Interests

There's also something to be said about taking a diverse set of
classes. Computer Science is really a subject that benefits from
interdisciplinary work. Whether it's math (Complexity
Theory/Theoretical Computer Science), physics (Quantum Computing),
biology (Computational Biology), art (Interactive Media), film
(Computer Graphics/Visual Effects), music (Electronic Music), or
really any field, you can find some sort of use for computer science.

Or don't! Just enjoy a different subject. I'm a strong believer in
having a diverse set of interests to challenge your mind. If you
exercise the same mental muscles and research the same areas, you'll
develop ruts and routines that will be harder to change. Want to avoid
being someone stuck in their ways? Try new things!

A good challenge is to imagine yourself meeting someone new, say at a
party, and having to talk about yourself without boring them with CS
talk. What could you discuss?

Better yet, do this in real life. Go meet someone new. Talk to them
about your interests. See what you actually have going on in your life
besides programming.

# Free Time

Some people I know who take a lot of CS courses respond that they just
want to learn all of these subjects and what's so wrong with that?
Well, for one they're assuming that courses are the only way to
learn a subject. Sometimes courses are genuinely great ways to learn,
but not if you're barely keeping up with the workload. I love having
enough free time to explore my interests on my own. It's really nice
being able to read a paper or write some code without stressing about
my courses.

Plus you might literally run out of courses to take. This may be hard
to believe, but there's really not a lot of courses in NYU
CS. Especially since realistically, you're not gonna be interested in
every topic.

Even if you find a lot of courses interesting, I wouldn't recommend
taking them all. The term FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) wouldn't normally
come to mind, but a lot of academically strong students actually have
FOMO with courses. They see one amazing course here and another
amazing course there and soon they're taking a full CS/math schedule
with no breaks. Not great. Instead, internalize that you won't be able
to learn everything or take all the cool classes. Take what you can
realistically manage and enjoy, then self teach the rest if you so
desire.

# Mental Mindshare

And finally, beyond time, beyond number of interests, the metric that
matters the most is mental mindshare. Basically, there's only so much
time you can spend programming in one day. For some, this number is
larger than others. But it's almost always less than one would like.

Doesn't matter who you are. Fran Allen, Donald Knuth, Alan Turing
himself, programming is a hard task and not really feasible to do for
long hours, day after day. Even if you manage to be amazingly
organized and disciplined, even if you manage to somehow have a few
hours each day to work on your own interests, it won't matter because
you've used your entire mental mindshare on your classes. Even if it's
not your daily programming mindshare, there's still the mental
overhead of assignments, of impending tests, of obligations.

Depending on what you want to accomplish and how much of your time you
spend working on your own projects, this may not mean as much to
you. But for me it matters a lot.

# Conclusion

I've been trying to write fewer conclusions to posts because they tend
to be awkward and redundant but for this post I kinda think it needs
one.

I'm not saying you should take the bare minimum for CS classes. I'm
not saying you shouldn't take that course which looks really
cool. What I am saying is that you don't have to get all of your CS
education from classes, and that more classes is not always
better. Factor in your mental health, your outside interests, your
free time and your mental mindshare, then decide whether you want to
take that extra course.
