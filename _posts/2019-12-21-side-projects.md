Side projects are incredibly important. They're arguably more
important than your actual courses in terms of job applications or
even how much you learn. They help you learn practical technologies
like front end development, back end server dev, deployment/DevOps,
etc. They give you experience with long term codebases and working
with other people. Plus you get to work on whatever *you* want. Any
crazy idea you have, any fun little project you want, you can work on.

# I Don't Have Time...

Of course, when I bring up side projects, there's this inevitable
answer; "Oh I'd *love* to work on something but I'm just *so* busy"
Which I'm not going to contradict. It's not my place to say if you're
too busy or not. Sometimes people genuinely have too much going
on, whether it's work, mental health or something else.

At the same time, I get this answer *so* often, that I've become a
tiny bit skeptical---especially with NYU CAS students. NYU CAS's
curriculum is not monstrous in terms of work. There's harder courses
than others, but really students aren't being pummeled with work like
at other schools.

If I had to guess why students constantly say they have no time, I'd
venture that a lot of students kind of divide their time into two
sections: time spent on school/work/etc. and time spent doing fun
stuff. When someone says "I don't have time", they often actually mean
"I don't want to take from the time I have to do fun stuff". Which is
fine! But the answer isn't to avoid side projects. It's to find a
side project that you find fun.

Take something you find interesting, programming related or not. Try
to figure out a way to have technology make it easier. If you can't
come up with an idea, ask your friends or people in the community. I
guarantee one of them has some sort of problem or frustration. Boom,
now you have a side project.

# Indignant Noises

The second most common answer I get with side projects is some
indignant noises about how employers demanding side projects is
unreasonable and age biased and late stage capitalism and therefore
the devil. And sure, I wouldn't expect full fledged professionals to
be judged on their side projects, much as I wouldn't expect a doctor
to be judged on how much medicine they did outside of their
practice. But students are not full fledged professionals. If you have
no job experience and only limited programming knowledge, a side
project demonstrates that you can actually code to some extent.

Some indignant noises make a claim that "other professions don't have
to deal with this!!!" Which...I just don't think is true. If anything,
other professions have to do far more unpaid bullshit work to get a
job. Politics majors have to do unpaid internships. Pre-med students
need to volunteer at clinics or labs. Science majors need to do
research. What's a few measly hours programming something you find
interesting compared to that?

# Getting Started

## Idea

First, you need an idea. As aforementioned, take an area you find
interesting, let's say cooking. Think about various apps or projects
you can do with cooking. Maybe you can make an app that gives a random
recipe from a certain type of cuisine. Or maybe you can make an app
that gives recipes based on the contents of one's fridge. Honestly the
idea doesn't have to be great. It doesn't have to be original and it
doesn't have to be that interesting. One of my first side projects was
just a blog written in Ruby on Rails. Literally the least creative
idea possible.

People often wait for the perfect idea. I say the first idea is the
perfect idea.

## Stack

Next you need a stack. For your first project, try to use what you
know. If that's Java and Python, then Java and Python it is! My
cardinal rule with new technology is that I try to learn one thing at
a time. Therefore I don't write an app in Swift with a Kotlin backend
when I know neither. That's just asking for trouble. This is harder to
accomplish when you're new to programming, since everything is
new. But you can start by focusing on one aspect of the
project. Perhaps you can write the front end before focusing on the
back end. Or perhaps you can just write the database code.

When you're learning your one new thing, try to keep a tight cycle of
reading-writing-applying. Basically, read the necessary
documentation/tutorials, write the code necessary to learn the
feature, then apply it immediately to the side project. That way you
keep it applicable and don't get stuck in the weeds of learning this
technology (which can be pretty boring imo). The cardinal rule of side
projects is to get **something** done. This something doesn't have to
be impressive. It just needs to be done.

## Code Code Code

Once you've learned juuuuust enough to get started, code like mad!
Hopefully you should find this interesting enough that this isn't a
chore. Try to keep the momentum going. I find that I work in spurts,
i.e. I code a bunch in a few days, then I step away for a bit. Maybe
you work differently. That's fine too.

As you get more comfortable with one technology, you can introduce
another. Maybe you start by building the front end, but as you get
better at front end, you can learn back end stuff too.

## End

The secret to most side projects is that there usually isn't an
end. There's just a point where you stop working on them. Really,
that's true with any code.

Don't feel like you need to keep projects alive just because. If it's
no longer interesting to you, then you can drop it. Sometimes you'll
come back to the project. Or sometimes you'll slog through a boring
section and it'll get better. But if it stays boring and
uninteresting, just ditch it.


# Git

I've harped on this point a lot, but really try to learn git for side
projects. Not only is it incredibly useful for saving your work and
trying out ideas while being able to roll back, you can also flex by
pushing your project to GitHub and showing off your account. Plus it's
very helpful if you have collaborators.

If you don't want to bother with Git, consider
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/). It's an online Google Docs-esque
platform for JavaScript applications. You can collaborate with other
people and it takes care of deployment.

# Collaborators

Speaking of, collaborators are really awesome if you can find
them. It's hard to find someone with the same work ethic and
interests, but if you can, it's immensely valuable. I'd highly
recommend asking around if people want to work on a project together.

You can find collaborators at any stage of the project. If you find
someone to collaborate with at the beginning, you can work together to
get the project off the ground and teach each other the various
technologies. If you find someone later, they can give you a fresh
perspective on the code and point out flaws or confusing parts. Plus
you can teach them the codebase and relevant technologies.  Which is a
great addition for a resume or talking point on an interview. People
love it when you mentor others.

However, you shouldn't let your project live or die by other
people. If your collaborator doesn't do their work, don't use it as an
excuse to not do your work. It's tempting to get discouraged, but
ultimately you're responsible for what you want to get done.

# Conclusion

Programming is a very unique skill in that it's immediately
applicable. You can learn a little programming and immediately start
using it in very cool ways. It's almost like getting
superpowers. Whatever interests you have, it can be improved using
programming. If you can find a project you find fascinating along with
the time and will to get it done, you'll become a far better (and more
employable) programmer. If a project *really* takes off, you could
have a startup on your hands!

Hopefully you've already started brainstorming side project ideas. Now
go out there and get coding!
