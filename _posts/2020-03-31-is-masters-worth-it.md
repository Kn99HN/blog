I've met more than a few people who have decided to pursue a masters
degree, whether in the 5 years bachelors masters program or
separately. And sometimes they're worth it. And sometimes they're not.

I'd like to preface this post with a disclaimer that this is a little
outside my normal area of knowledge---I am not a masters student nor
do I plan on getting a masters. However I have taken masters courses
and chatted with both masters students and professors about masters
students. Nonetheless take what I say with a grain of salt, if you
don't already. Also I don't mean any disrespect to current or previous
masters students. Anybody willingly pursuing more education has my
respect.

# Why?

I'd say that the main reasons you should get a masters degree are:

- You have a bachelors in a different field and want a CS degree
- You received your bachelors in a different country and want a degree
  in the US for job/visa reasons
- You want to do research and/or prepare for a PhD
- Your employer is paying for it.

If you've already gotten your bachelors in a different subject,
anything from French Literature to Civil Engineering, then a masters
may be a good idea. You'll get the necessary credentials to apply for
jobs and the background knowledge to match. Depending on your existing
skills, you may have to enroll in a program such as [Bridge to
Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/bridge-program-nyu-tandon)
(not to be confused with Bridge To Terabithia). These programs provide
the necessary knowledge you may require for a masters program if you
don't have a technical background.

However you don't *need* a masters to transition into a CS career. You
can certainly transition from fields such as math or physics to CS
without a masters. This transition may not be easy, as you'll need to
teach yourself programming and start building [side
projects](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/21/side-projects.html),
but you can definitely do it.

Likweise if you're a foreign national who would like to come live and
work in the United States, a degree from an American university will
help with that process. Not to mention it'll get you a student visa
which means you can get a year or two to network, travel, etc.

If you want to do research, a masters degree can be a good **stepping
stone** for this goal. I say stepping stone because a masters degree
generally is not enough to do real, truly novel research. If you want
to be one of those high paid ML/AI researchers, you'll need a
PhD. Masters degrees are great for giving you access to a university's
faculty, research labs and libraries, which can all be used to build
up your CV should you choose to apply for a PhD.

Not that you *need* a masters to pursue a research career. You can
definitely jump from a bachelors to a PhD program without doing a
masters. Heck most PhD programs will toss you a masters halfway
through.

If you just want some specialized knowledge but not necessarily
research, a masters could definitely be a good idea. Want to take a
deep dive into databases but not so far that you're attempting to
write a paper formally proving serializability? A masters might be
up your alley.

Finally, you could be in the lucky position where your employer is
paying for the masters degree. Often times they'll give you a raise
upon receiving the degree. This is definitely a solid option. However
this usually means you have to do a masters on top of your day job,
which can be stressful and also take a lot longer. Plus you're already
employed at a company which is willing to buy you a masters. Do you
really need it at that point?

# Why Not?

For one, you have to pay for a masters. Even if it's a 5 year program,
that's still another year of tuition. For a full fledged program
that's a 1.5-2 years of tuition. This is an important distinction
versus a PhD which is financed by grants. You almost never have to pay
tuition for a PhD.

This distinction translates also into people's perception of masters
programs. The unfortunate truth is that some people, professors and
others as well, may perceive masters students as revenue streams for
the university and PhD students as potential researchers/mentees. This
is not always true; professors can certainly mentor masters
students. But it's worth keeping in mind.

Masters courses can also be hit or miss; some of them are more
advanced than undergrad while others are arguably less rigorous. This
is because masters programs have to cater towards students with a
larger variance in terms of knowledge. Students may come in with a top
notch CS background and students may come in with little to no
background.

Likewise you're not going to get much more in terms of job placement
with a masters. Maybe it'll polish up a resume that is otherwise on
the weak side, but a solid bachelors with good extracurriculars and
internships will get you extremely far. A masters isn't guaranteed
net monetary gain.

One reason you should definitely **not** use to get a masters is just
to prolong your undergrad. Yes, the real world is scary. But you're
spending a lot of money to avoid it. Get a job, take a year off, heck
join the Peace Corps.

And please don't get a masters as an academic trophy. If you enjoy the
topic and enjoy learning, then great. But don't get one because you
feel obligated to get one or because you believe it imparts prestige.
