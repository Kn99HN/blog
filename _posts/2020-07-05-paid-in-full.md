If you're lucky and your internship hasn't been cancelled, you're
working this summer. For some of you, the company you're working for
may be a little...less efficient with their HR process. I've certainly
worked for places that didn't exactly have the razor efficiency of
Microsoft HR.

More bluntly, your company may be screwing up your pay. Don't let
them. Your pay should be on time and in full. You should have an
itemized list of withheld amounts, such as for taxes, Medicare,
etc. No excuses.

It may take time to set up your pay, whether that's due to paperwork,
direct deposit issues or whatever. But it should not take months to
set up your pay.

If you haven't been paid, either HR has screwed up, the company cannot
afford payroll or you're getting screwed. The first one is fixable but
unacceptable. The last two are also fixable---get a new job. If the
company cannot afford payroll, they're probably going under. If you're
getting exploited, the job isn't worth your dignity.

Make sure your pay is in your contract. You should have a clear amount
in writing. Before you do any work, this amount should be agreed upon.

When you get paid, double check the math. I've gotten stiffed on my
pay. And don't accept the generic answer of "well taxes take a lot
out". I've gotten paychecks where my tax rate worked out to 40 or 50
percent. That's not right[^1].

[^1]: Math-wise that is. Policy wise? Meh

If you haven't gotten paid, tell your boss that you cannot in good
conscience work without pay. You will not be doing any work until the
pay issue is remedied. The pay issue might be fixed faster than you
expect. You may think "oh but I'm just a lowly intern, they can fire me
for saying that". Interns are hard to hire. They'd lose a lot more
money in recruiting costs and onboarding than if they just paid
you. If they do actually fire you then **good**. You likely dodged a
bullet. Plus you can still take them to small claims court for the pay
(I am not a lawyer so double check this).

If they try to guilt you, screw them. You deserve to be paid on time
and in full. Repeat that to yourself. If a fast food worker can be
paid on time and in full, so can you.

Some interns take a small transgression on their part as a reason to
absolve a larger transgression on the company's part. Something along
the lines of: "I'm taking too long to write this component, so it's
okay that they didn't pay me on time." That is utter nonsense. First,
there's nothing wrong with taking a little longer to write something,
especially as an intern. Second, even mediocre engineers deserve to be
paid on time and in full.

Everybody deserves to be paid on time and in full. That's why we work
at jobs in the first place. When I go to a restaurant, I expect my
food to come in a reasonable amount of time and in its full
quantity. I don't expect half of a burger 2 hours late.

You should be paid on time and in full.
