## Get Out

Let's cut to the chase. You've been cornered by some entrepreneur
who's pitching you on his lame idea. How do you get out?

Start by making some non-committal noises about how the idea looks
very interesting and you can definitely see a niche. Do not criticize
the idea, as that will only lead to a flurry of justification and
debate.

If you're a student or early in your development career, you can make
some small claims about how you're not sure if you're ready to work on
such a big task. Play up how inexperienced you are.
