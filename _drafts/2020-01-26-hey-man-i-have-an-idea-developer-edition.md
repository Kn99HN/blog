Before I covered the entrepreneur side. Now let's do the developer
side.

# Developers

## Do You Want It?

Do you want to do a startup? If not, then don't even entertain the
idea. There's no point.

If you do want to do a startup, make sure it's for the right
reasons. If you can't get a job offer, don't go and do a startup as a
backup option. Don't do it to get rich. Don't do a startup to prove
how smart you are.

## Evaluating Ideas

Companies follow a very specific philosophy for hiring: It's better to
reject a good candidate than accept a bad one. Hence, if even one
interviewer is hesitant or iffy on a candidate, the company
rejects. You should follow the same rule when evaluating startup
ideas. It doesn't matter if the idea *might* be good. If you aren't
100% sure that it's a good idea, right this second, reject.

Some people may say that you only see the appeal of certain ideas if
you're in a specific niche. That may be true, but you don't want to
waste a year or two of your life (worth at least 6 figures in salary
plus all the other missed opportunities) on an idea that *could* be
good according to a person who is not yourself.

When evaluating ideas, you should always ask yourself if you would use
the product. And be honest! Don't say "maybe, yeah, I could see myself
using xyz". No. You either want to use it or you don't.

## Get Out

Let's say you're not interested. How do you get out?

Start by making some non-committal noises about how the idea looks
very interesting and you can definitely see a niche. Do not criticize
the idea, as that will only lead to a flurry of justification and
debate. Often times people who pitch startup ideas to strangers are
vigorously and viciously defensive of their idea. Don't provoke them.

If you're a student or early in your development career, you can make
some small claims about how you're not sure if you're ready to work on
such a big task. Play up how inexperienced you are. Make it sound like
you don't know anything.

If that doesn't work, then just try to exit the conversation as
quickly as possible. Sometimes this isn't easy. Sometimes it's a
relative or family friend who you can't duck. But just continue making
non-commital statements until you can leave.
