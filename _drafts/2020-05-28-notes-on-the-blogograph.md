NOTE: Probabbly should save this post for the one year anniversary
I've been writing this blog for <x> time. I've learned a lot about how
to write blogs, such as:

- Don't write awkward stitled intros or conclusions. Jump into
  the content and leave just as quickly.

- Remove as many filler words like "Okay but", "um", "so", etc. as
  possible without sounding like a robot. It's more than you'd think.

- Or as Strunk and White espouse: Omit needless words.

- Keep track of words you use a lot and vary accordingly.

- Don't keep saying that you think this or IMO that. This entire blog
  is your opinion. You don't need to repeat it.

- Any post that sits in your drafts for too long won't make it. Just
  kill it.

- It's okay to kill a post and revive it.

- If you're out of ideas for posts, talk with people and keep track of
  your kvetches.

- Try to make posts shorter (still working on that!)
