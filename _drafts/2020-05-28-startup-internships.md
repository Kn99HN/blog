If there's one thing I'd get rid of in the CS community, it's early
stage startups offering internships. You see this all the time,
whether it's on the [opportunities mailing
list](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/opportunities.html), on job
postings, or mentioned in passing by the startup founder. Simply put,
these are scams.

I'm not talking about funded startups offering paid internships. These
are perfectly fine. I'm talking about the startup that is pre-funding
or seed funded that is trying to get free labor out of unsuspecting
students.

As I've mentioned, you should care about [technical
mentorship](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/05/19/technical-mentorship.html). An
early stage startup does not have time to mentor an intern. The
developers at an early stage startup are working at full capacity to
keep the ship afloat. They're not going to mentor you.

Instead, they'll try to use you as free labor. As a code-monkey who
can help them be the next Facebook. Not only is that exploitative,
it's **stupid**. Any company that genuinely believes unpaid
interns---without guidance or mentorship---can produce useful code is
a company run by morons.

You'll also have a mountain of work. Startups by their very nature
have a practically endless amount of work. You'll be stuck with no
guidance and a massive pile of tasks to get done. Not fun.

Often times this is a move pulled by startups run by non-technical
people. Non-technical people often fall into the classic trap of
assuming that more programmers means more code means more
features. Yeah...[that's not how that
works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law). If you see an
offer for an unpaid internship at a startup where there is no
technical leadership, **run**. Well you should be running anyways
since unpaid internship at a startup should sound as good as "unpaid
grunt in burning tire fire".

But say you're a student, you don't have any experience and besides,
you don't need the cash. A few months at an unpaid startup gig doesn't
sound so bad, right?

Yeah it is damn well is pretty bad. You are actively helping a person
who is blatantly exploiting people, namely yourself. There's so many
other ways you could fill your free time. Work in a [side
project](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/21/side-projects.html). Contribute
to open source. [Read stuff on the
internet](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/02/10/how-much-do-you-read.html). Send
out more applications. Everything's remote these days. Send out
applications to every company you can imagine.

If you truly have nothing to do, i.e. you've sent out 300
applications; you're unable to build a side project for whatever
reason; you've read all you can read on programming, then at the very
least, you deserve to be compensated at this startup. If they can't
pay you in cash, fine. You should get equity^[1]. And don't let them
call you an intern. If they can't afford to pay you, they can't afford
to call you an intern.

[1]: Although that's probably a terrible idea since the equity will most likely be worth zero. That being said, it demonstrates a certain amount of respect.
