I was talking to a friend of mine when we started discussing our
different experiences with internships. We both agreed that our
internship experiences have varied, that an internship can mean one of
a few quite different jobs. An internship can be an apprenticeship, an
extended job interview or an underpaid junior developer position. Each
of these comes with its downsides and its upsides, but it's absolutely
essential to know which one you need in your current state, and which
one you'll get when you apply to a company.
