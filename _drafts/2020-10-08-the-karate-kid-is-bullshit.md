The Karate Kid is a bullshit movie. It's about a kid who learns karate
from a mysterious sensei, trains for like 3 months and wins a
tournament against far better competitors. Anybody who's done a
competitive sport can tell you that's not how this works.

If The Karate Kid was a realistic movie, Daniel would start training
with Mr. Miyagi, go to a competition and get his ass kicked. Hell he'd
go to ten tournaments and get his ass kicked. He'd realize that to get
good, he needs to spar with people, specifically people who aren't his
70 year-old sensei. Different people have different styles. He'd
probably join Cobra Kai or at least another dojo with other students.

Daniel would also realize that winning a tournament isn't easy. It's
not a matter of winning against another team as much as winning over
30, maybe 40 people. Getting to the top means being in the top 2-3% of
karate practitioners. That takes time. Most people don't ever make it
that far. Daniel would need to train for at least a few years before
making it.

Wait, isn't this supposed to be a tech blog?

As it turns out, there's some similarities between The Karate Kid and
how people view tech recruiting[^1]. A lot of people are obsessed
about getting into FAANG/big N/unicorns. Hell, one of the [first
posts](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/11/14/get-that-big-n-job.html)
on this blog was about just that. I wrote it because I knew it would
catch people's attention.

[^1]: Well, that and I do legitimately think The Karate Kid is a dumb
    movie that teaches you the wrong ideas about sports.

All of these big N make up a few tiny percentage points of
developers. Google famously has a 0.2% acceptance rate, more
prestigious than any Ivy League.

Students obsess over these companies, yet the majority of students
start programming in college. They start with little to no programming
knowledge. And yet, they expect to get into the top 1% of developers
within what, 2-3 years?

When you put it that way, it sounds a lot more ridiculous. Granted,
there's some differences between programming and karate. Since a lot
of students start from zero, there's a more even playing field. There
are genuinely people who start from zero and end up at Google by
junior year. But they're rare. They're the Daniel LaRusso[^2]'s of
tech. And even most of them don't go work at Google as their first
job. They intern at some small place then work up to Google.

[^2]: That's the protagonist of The Karate Kid if you haven't seen it.

I definitely was not a Daniel LaRusso. I started programming when I
was 15. I interned at two places and programmed for five years before
I went to a big N. I didn't just walk in and end up in the top 1% of
programmers. I just happened to get started a little earlier.

Taking the analogy a little further, if you want to get to the top 1%
of programmers, you should start sparring. No, I don't mean
competitive programming. I mean you should start seeing who you're
competing with. There's a lot of talented programmers out there. Start
seeing what they're doing, and try to catch up. I keep a mental list
of good programmers around my age. I've actually started to reach out
to them.

Don't see them as competitors though. See them as benchmarks. I've had
people confidently tell me that they wanted to get a Google internship
when they could barely program. A little bit of GitHub stalking or
resume reading would show them the issues with that aspiration.

I don't want to rain on someone's parade. There's certainly a chance
you'll read a Facebook intern's resume and come away unimpressed. I
know people who undervalue their skills and could easily be Facebook
or Microsoft interns. And even if you're not skilled, all that means
is you need to train a little longer. Go make some side projects. Go
work at other places. Then come back and apply to the big N.

Besides the big N shouldn't always be the goal. There's a lot of
issues with big N, which I went over in [my post about
them](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/11/14/get-that-big-n-job.html).
