Everybody's so damn busy these days. People are taking 20 credits,
working part-time, running clubs, doing everything and anything. Maybe
it's just the bubble of nerds that I hang out with, but it truly feels
like every year there's more to do in less time.

Which is odd. Looking back on my experiences, some of my most
effective and important times in my life were when I was distinctly
not busy. When I had too much time on my hands. When I was on my gap
year and couldn't find a job, so I'd spend hours making a blog with
Ruby on Rails and going to hackathons. When I'd aimlessly learn Rust
or decide to check out a tutorial on interpreters.

If you're thinking that this sounds productive and perhaps busy in a
sense, I would disagree. I started learning these things because I had
read through reddit, scrolled through Facebook and could not
extinguish my boredom. I learned because I had nothing better to do.

This is what a lot of people miss when they try to do side
projects. They try to work on a side project while tackling mounds of
schoolwork, while trying to balance work, while their mind is
full. There is something to be said about having constraints, but it's
hard to devote the mental effort when you're so damn busy and so damn
tired. The work becomes painful. You start to lose interest.

Of course some busyness is unavoidable. I'm lucky enough that I could
be supported by my parents. Others do not have that luxury. But other
busyness can be avoided. Don't take more classes than necessary. Take
some easy classes with your hard ones. Don't take classes while you
work full-time. Avoid gathering responsibilities.
