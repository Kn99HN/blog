I've written about a multitude of subjects on this blog. Mostly areas
that everybody kind of agrees are important. Maybe people will quibble
over a detail or two but nobody's disagreeing that you should get an
internship or work on a side project or two.

That ends today! I'm going to discuss an area that some may find
disagreeable. I'm going to discuss the humanities and why you should
learn them.

At NYU CAS, for better or worse, we are required to get a liberal arts
education. We are required to take classes on history (Cultures &
Context), literature (Text & Ideas), writing (Writing the Essay), art
(Expressive Cultures), social sciences (Societies and the Social
Sciences), and foreign languages. The ostensible purpose of these
courses are to provide "a foundational academic experience of general
education in the liberal arts for undergraduates".

I don't disagree with this sentiment. I'll expand shortly on why these
foundation is necessary. But before that, I'd like to emphasize:

> Studying the humanities is **NOT** the same as taking core classes

One common misunderstanding I see students making is taking the core
classes, finding them boring, then writing off all humanities.

The problem is that core classes are *hard to teach*. You're not
teaching a traditional major based intro class, so you can't spend too
much time on the basics, but you also can't jump into the more
advanced topics that are interesting because they require too much
technicalities.

If I had to teach a programming class where students came in with zero
experience, and would do zero programming after the fact, I'd find it
very very hard to make it interesting.

With that point made, let's delve into why humanities.

# Contextualization

Programming doesn't exist in a void. Each and every one of us, by
programming, is effecting change on the world. To quote Marc
Andreessen, software truly is eating the world. As programmers, we
hold immense power. Our code holds people's most private secrets. Our
models read their data and invade their privacy.

Humanities can give us insight into these issues. For instance the
concept of [surveillance
capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism),
created by Shoshana Zuboff, is a crucial concept behind companies such
as Google and Facebook. Or we can analyze historical issues like IBM's
business with Nazi Germany in the context of modern tech.

I'm not saying you should forgo your job or take certain stances, but
it's good to have some awareness of how your work impacts the world.

# Communication

Even though it's nice to imagine everybody communicates via ProtoBufs,
that's not reality. As I've outlined before, learning to [write a good
email](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/19/sent-from-my-iphone.html)
is extremely important. Likewise you'll need to write documentation,
articles, maybe even a paper or two.

The common response to this point is that technical writing doesn't
require reading James Baldwin. And yes, you could certainly restrict
yourself to reading solely technical literature. But you'd run into
two problems: most technical literature is rather poorly written and
is quite boring. I guarantee that you'll have a better time reading
[Letter From A Region In My
Mind](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind)
than most technical literature. Plus if you can take even an ounce of
the aliteration and poetry of Baldwin and infuse it into your writing,
you'll be far better along than most technical writers.

Another important quality is style. Even in technical writing, style
is crucial. Whether it's the rather idiosyncratic, pseudo-socratic
style of The Little Schemer, where Lisp is taught via a dialogue
between two people, or the mystical wisdom of the Tao of Programming,
style allows you to convey complicated ideas in charming or
interesting fashions.

Without the writing I've read, I'm not sure I could write this blog.

# Empathy

Empathy is often considered immutable: one either has empathy or does
not. I don't agree. Empathy is a quality that must be
exercised. Humanities provide you with a variety of ways to increase
your empathy such as watching films or reading fiction. Roger Ebert
famously said that films are the greatest empathy machine.

> Movies are the most powerful empathy machine in all the arts. When I
> go to a great movie I can live somebody else's life for a while. I
> can walk in somebody else's shoes. I can see what it feels like to
> be a member of a different gender, a different race, a different
> economic class, to live in a different time, to have a different
> belief

The flip side of empathy being mutable is that it's possible to lose
one's empathy. If you spend too much time debating yes-and-no, 1's and
0's, then you might begin to see the world in that lens. Which might
be great if you want to work on your
[Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)) impression, but
will make it harder to connect with people.

# Subjectivity

If there's one presque-universal sin of technical people, it's a
fetishization of objectivity. I can't count the amount of times I've
heard the slightly-condescending opening remark of "objectively...",
which inevitably is followed by some argument furthering a subjective
point.

I don't know why that is. Well actually I do. Objectivity is prized in
the sciences because one can be somewhat objective in science. However
once you stretch your view beyond the technical and start analyzing
the messiness of our world, objectivity quickly becomes impossible.
