I'm a habitual book buyer. I amass books in far excess of how many I
can feasibly read. I'm fortunate to be ~~enabled~~ supported by my
parents in this book collecting (they're book hoarders as
well). Through this endless amassing, I've picked up some useful
books. Some of these I've read. Others I've skimmed. Hopefully you can
pick a few up, and maybe read them too.

**Preface:** I'm not including any books already in the [wonderful
list](https://blog.codinghorror.com/recommended-reading-for-developers/)
by Jeff Atwood. Look at that list and buy a few of those too.

# How To Solve It

I've mentioned this one before. It's quite useful for learning problem
solving techniques. Whether you're trying to survive math classes or
practice for technical interviews, problem solving is a very useful
skill. It's even useful in programming. Shocker, I know.

A lot of these skills boil down to being utterly ruthless and tricky
when it comes to solving problems. A lot of people take a very
rudimentary, very brute force approach to solving problems. They look
at the problem and try to understand it and think of solutions. That's
great for simple problems, but for harder ones, you'll need a little
more technique. For instance, it can be useful to think about
converting the problem into a different, easier one. Or thinking about
simplifying the problem. Or making it more concrete.

Sometimes you can even circumvent the problem entirely. Can't get a
library to work? How about you use a different one?

What we do as programmers mostly boils down to problem
solving. Technology is just our particular tool to solve the problem.

# Dreyer's English

If programming is mostly problem solving, the rest of it is
communication. Your solution is useless if other people cannot
understand it.

But why a book on writing? Can't the code communicate the solution?
Not always. Code doesn't tell you why it was written. It doesn't tell
you the history behind the decisions. It can't tell you the future
either, where one plans to develop, to change, to delete. Code is
restricted to the now and to the existing.

Not to mention, writing is more than just the act of putting text to
page. It's the fundamental composition of ideas into a cohesive
message. This is a key part of proper programming. Good code should
read like a carefully written sentence. Each element serves a clear,
unambiguous purpose. There should be no redundancy, no excess. There
should be a beauty in the idea, so delicately expressed.

And beyond narrative, beyond vocabulary, beyond fancy frivolous
displays such as alliteration, the core of writing is about grammar
and style. If your grammar is off, if your sentence sounds stilted and
strangled, your reader will not understand your writing.

Even worse, your reader may judge your intelligence from your
writing. When I review a résumé that has awkward, poorly phrased, or
even misspelled text, I have to force myself to ignore the form and
stick to the actual contents. I never succeed. One can never fully
disentangle the method of transmission from the contents.

Dreyer's English is a wonderful, funny and informative guide on
writing correctly. Some may recommend the classic [Strunk and
White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style), but
Dreyer's is up to date and less crotchety. Read it and your writing
will improve.

Of course this is only one step in the process of becoming a better
writer. With a healthy, balanced diet of reading (fiction, essays,
journalism, non-fiction, etc.) and some writing of your own, you'll be
well on your way towards being a better writer.
