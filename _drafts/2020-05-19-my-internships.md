I'm going to do something a little different. Because this blog has
clearly been lacking some self indulgence, I'm going to talk about my
personal journey interning and working at a few places. Due to a few
factors, I was lucky enough to start programming seriously in high
school. I then took a gap year, which allowed me to intern at two
different places. I then spent the summer after my freshman year
working on a Google Summer of Code project (not an internship!). The
summer after my sophomore year I was lucky enough to get an internship
at Microsoft. Finally I just finished a round of internship
applications for next fall and am interning at (TODO: Either Citadel
or Cloudflare). I'm going to walk through each internship, how I got
it and my overall experiences at the company. In general I've had
pretty positive experiences at all the places I've worked.

I've also been very lucky to have family connections, as well as a
group of very supportive mentors and friends.

# Internship #0: Lab Labor

My first internship, if you can even call it that, was at a lab over
the summer. The job was basically pity-given to me via a family
contact. I met the contact to ask about advice for research labs and
he took it as me asking if I could intern at his lab. In retrospect,
this wasn't really what either of us wanted. I learned that asking
someone a seemingly innocuous question can turn into accidentally
imposing on them.

As for the job, it was unpaid work that consisted of first programming
some models from various papers that I didn't really understand. I
wrote the first few models in MATLAB, then when that got unwieldy, I
switched to Java. I figured out a hacky way to get MATLAB to graph the
Java simulation by having Java output a bunch of text files that
described the simulation, then having MATLAB load them and graph it.

After that, I was partnered with a college student from Australia. He
and I were in charge of this project involving a mechanical fish. I'll
spare you the details but it involved attempting to waterproof a 3d
printed fish model that would contain expensive electronics. After
lots of failed attempts involving a 3d printer in one of the most
disgusting rooms I've ever seen and some really messy waterproofing
silicone material, I slipped away at the end of the summer.

# Internship #1: Finance

My first software development internship came about during the summer
after my senior year of high school. I had lazed around on the couch
for a month or so and my parents wanted me to do something with my
summer. Another family connection put me in contact with a hedge fund
using a Ruby and C++ stack. I emailed them and they set up an
interview. The interview consisted of them reading my resume, asking
about some projects and having me write some SQL. Even though I didn't
know that much, they were very nice and helpful.

I got the job and they put me on a task involving scraping data. I
quickly learned some basic Ruby and wrote a quick scraper with regular
expressions, confident that it would be merged quickly.

# Internship #2: Web Dev

# Internship #2.5: Google Summer of Code

# Internship #3: Big N Company
