I'm going to do something a little different. Because this blog has
clearly been lacking some self indulgence, I'm going to talk about my
personal journey interning and working at a few places. Due to a few
factors, I was lucky enough to start programming seriously in high
school. I then took a gap year, which allowed me to intern at two
different places. I then spent the summer after my freshman year
working on a Google Summer of Code project (not an internship!). The
summer after my sophomore year I was lucky enough to get an internship
at Microsoft. Finally I just finished a round of internship
applications for next fall and am interning at (TODO: Either Citadel
or Cloudflare). I'm going to walk through each internship, how I got
it and my overall experiences at the company. In general I've had
pretty positive experiences at all the places I've worked.
