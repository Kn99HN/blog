So you want a job. Not just any job though. A job at a place like
Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. In common parlance, these
are called "Big N" companies. As in, the Big 5, Big 10, Big "N"
companies in the tech world.

Another common grouping is FAANG, or Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix
and Google. This is kinda flawed for a few reasons. For one, Apple
hires a lot more electrical engineers than programmers, and Netflix
doesn't even hire interns.
