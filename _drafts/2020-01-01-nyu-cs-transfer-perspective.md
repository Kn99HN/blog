title: "NYU CS: A Transfer Perspective"

NYU CS needs work. Browsing recent reddit posts or discord messages, most responses about
NYU CS CAS are criticisms. Most are valid. But I would like to provide another perspective. 
Before reading this, I would suggest being familiar with [GOTO NYU CS Considered Harmful](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/11/12/goto-nyu-cs-considered-harmful.html), a previous post.

I transferred from University of Maryland, College Park CS to NYU CS. I would like to provide
my thoughts as a transfer student and someone who started programming in college.

Many who are familiar with both CS departments would wonder "Why the hell did you transfer?". On paper,
UMD CS is a lot stronger. The [courses](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/search?courseId=CMSC&sectionId=&termId=202101&_openSectionsOnly=on&creditCompare=&credits=&courseLevelFilter=ALL&instructor=&_facetoface=on&_blended=on&_online=on&courseStartCompare=&courseStartHour=&courseStartMin=&courseStartAM=&courseEndHour=&courseEndMin=&courseEndAM=&teachingCenter=ALL&_classDay1=on&_classDay2=on&_classDay3=on&_classDay4=on&_classDay5=on) offered are more abundant and interesting. The student body has a stronger
programming skills and the recruiting scene is decent. I agree. But here are a few reasons why I left.

# Class Size

There were 250 kids in my introductory courses. They were weed-out classes so the size made sense. Coming from a high school with 350 people, it was certainly difficult for me to adjust. On the upside, the curriculum for my [class](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2018/cmsc131-020X040X/) was rigorous given I had a really great [professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=313062).

However, due to its size, there was usually a long line to get help on projects during office hours. As a new programmer, these time slots were crucial for me to understand the assignments and reinforce my comprehension of the concepts from the lectures. I usually came early to avoid the crowd and was able to get guidance on more difficult projects. Those who came 30 minutes later were not so fortunate. There were days that I saw 20 stressed students cramming into single room waiting for help from 1 TA before the project was due. Not the greatest environment you wanted to be in. Overcrowdedness was also a problem during professor's office hours. Sometimes, there would be a line of people out the door waiting for help. Either you came early or came another time. It was hard to reach the lecturer to ask questions regarding the course materials. This could come at a disadvantage especially if you need recommendation letters and you haven't met with the professor for enough occasions. One of my friends also considered transferring but couldn't get a recommendation letter because he was told that he hadn't come to enough office hours. In addition, the class size left fewer opportunities to ask questions during lectures since the professors need to go through the course materials in a timely manner.

# Waitlisting

Two courses, Data Management and Applied Internet Technologies, demonstrate this problem with NYU CS. For the Spring 2021 term, their waitlists stretched to 120 students. However, it is not a foreign [problem](https://dbknews.com/2017/12/11/umd-computer-science-petition-waitlists-iribe-differential-tuition-class-size/) to UMD nor at [Columbia](https://www.facebook.com/columbiaconfessionz/posts/427826941899592). I suspect this also happens at other institutions as there is an increase in number of students majoring in CS. So it's unavoidable, especially with the more popular courses or professors. I recall being on the waitlist for introductory courses at UMD until the last day of add/drop period before getting a spot. 

The increase in students majoring in CS led to [Limited Enrollment Program](https://www.lep.umd.edu/computerscience.html#current) at UMD after my freshman year, which requires student to re-apply to the major after completing the required courses. This is done at University of Washington as [pre-major](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/). I'm supposed that it is a reasonable solution to keep the program competitive. The admission into the major is not guaranteed even if you do well in the required courses since the application is reviewed hollistically. Personally, I find it stressful to experience the anxiety of college application again after 2 years.

Solving waitlisting is difficult. The demand for CS courses keeps going up but universities don't quite have the resources to hire more qualified faculty. One possible solution specific to NYU CS was outlined [here](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/12/08/waitlisted-professor-allocation.html) but I'm not sure if it can be done any time soon.

Though there were some downsides, I truly enjoyed the courses. I built a solid foundation before transferring. I found great friends and met brilliant TAs as well as inspiring professors. However, I wasn't really happy and decided to leave. By the time I left, I promised myself that I would make the most out of my CS education at NYU. So here are a few things I enjoy about NYU CS and how one can make the most out of your time here.

# Classes
The CS requirement courses at NYU are lackluster. It doesn't cover enough. Fortunately, the classes needed to cover the CS foundation are still available. If you choose the right professor, I believe the materials are quite on par and you will get the most out of it. Yes, yes, CS is difficult and sometimes you want to coast through certain classes. But if you are serious about your CS education, the only way is to put in the work. Here are my recommendations:
## Math
- Calculus I, II and III
- Discrete Math
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics OR Theory of Probability and Statistics

## Computer Science
- Introductory course
- [Data Structures - Joanna Klukowska](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs102_f20/)
- [Computer Systems - Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/fa18-cso/)
- [Basic Algorithms - Victor Shoup](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall20/CSCI-UA.0310-001/)
- [Programming Languages - Edward Yang](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0490-001/) OR the graduate version
- [Operating System - Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/classes/20sp/)

These courses are collected from the experiences of my friends and myself. I hope this doesn't steer you away from these professors. Rather, I hope to have you seek them out during registration process. I hope one day to see professor Shoup's Basic Algorithm course having a waitlist before other sections. [^0] 

[^0]: There are also courses such as Theory of Computing, Numerical Computing, Abstract Algebra (recommended by professor [Shoup](https://www.shoup.net/)) and others that cover more ground but the list above is good enough to hit the ground running for your CS education.

# Recruiting

NYU CS recruiting is not great[^1]. However, unless you are at MIT, CMU or other top CS programs, it requires lots of hustle on your own. 
Career fair is definitely a great starting point for landing an internship offer. However, don't discount other methods as well. Professors are great resources for internships. If you did well in their classes, you should ask them for referrals or research opportunities. They will have connections in the industry or know someone that can guide you. They might also be the [founder](https://cs.nyu.edu/~korth/) of [hackNY](https://hackny.org/)! Wasserman often hosts coffee chats with employers and alumni[^2]. Attend these events and talk to as many people as you can. These events are set up to network so remeber to ask for people's contact information and reach out. They can help mentor you or put you in touch with recruiters. These events are also often hosted by student organizations such as [WinC](https://nyuwinc.org/upcoming-events) or [Tech@NYU](https://techatnyu.org/events). In addition, reach out to your peers! If you notice someone that has more experience, shoot them an email and introduce yourself. They can help improve your resume or carry out mock technical interviews with you. If you start programming in college like I did, I suggest finding internships as soon as possible since you are already behind in terms of programming ability. Don't be afraid of applying with no experience. If you are lucky, you might land your first offer. If not, you can have few rounds of practice interviews or you may receive recruiters' emails, which you should save and [cold email](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/19/sent-from-my-iphone.html) the following internship cycle.

[^1]: Interestingly enough, I got an interview at Microsoft through NYU and also an internship offer from a hedge fund through On-Campus Interview at Wasserman.

[^2]: Before the pandemic, I have attended coffee chats with companies such as PDT Partners, GrubHub, Microsoft, Chewy, Splunk, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs and some smaller firms in NYC. The alumni events usually consist of SWEs working at FAANG companies.

Luck is also at play here. It took me 350 applications for a sophomore internship and 200 for a junior internship. On the other hand, my friend received a handful of interviews after 50 applications. It really depends on your situations so keep applying until you get an offer!

In addition to internship experience, there are great projects developed by NYU student with medium-sized codebase you can work on such as [Schedge](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/schedge). There are also lots of open source projects on GitHub. They are great entry points to software development. You can learn a great deal just by contributing and asking questions.

So code, learn, apply and do your best. NYU CS might not have the greatest recruiting scene but that doesn't mean you can't succeeed!

# Final Thoughts
NYU CS needs improvements. The department needs the support from CAS, Courant, the faculty and the alumni, especially during a pandemic.
If you are at NYU and disappointed after reading reddit posts or previous blogs, I hope this provides a way to take advantage of all the courses and resources in the department. Rather than worrying about the environment, it might be more productive to make the best out of it and blame it after graduation.

Though I have my gripe with the CS department here and there, I'm generally happier at NYU. It's a combination of many factors. I enjoy meeting [Schedge creator](https://github.com/A1Liu), [Torch author](https://github.com/NicholasLYang) and [NYU CS Discord admin](https://github.com/esilverm). I enjoy going to [meetups in Microsoft Midtown Office](https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/). I enjoy having a diverse student body both in terms of race and geography. I enjoy the accessibility to restaurants [^3]. NYU CS is not perfect by any means but there are reasons other than the courses you should consider before choosing a school[^4].

[^3]: Trust me, when there are only 10 restaurants near your college with only 5 that are actually decent, you would get bored pretty quickly. As someone who doesn't party that much, I prefer grabbing good with friends so NYC is truly a blessing.

[^4]: The biggest one is financial reason. Don't get into debts for college!!!
