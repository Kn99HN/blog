NYU CS needs work. Browsing recent reddit posts or discord messages, most responses about
NYU CS CAS are criticisms. Most are valid. But I would like to provide another perspective. 
This, however, won't be a post filled with positives to raise your expectation about NYU CS. Before reading this, I would suggest reading
[this](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/11/12/goto-nyu-cs-considered-harmful.html) first.

I transferred from University of Maryland, College Park CS to NYU CS. I would like to provide
my thoughts as a transfer student and someone who started programming in college.

Many who are familiar with both CS departments would wonder "Why the hell did you transfer?". On paper,
UMD CS is a lot stronger. The [courses](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/search?courseId=CMSC&sectionId=&termId=202101&_openSectionsOnly=on&creditCompare=&credits=&courseLevelFilter=ALL&instructor=&_facetoface=on&_blended=on&_online=on&courseStartCompare=&courseStartHour=&courseStartMin=&courseStartAM=&courseEndHour=&courseEndMin=&courseEndAM=&teachingCenter=ALL&_classDay1=on&_classDay2=on&_classDay3=on&_classDay4=on&_classDay5=on) offered are more abundant and interesting. The student body has a stronger
programming skills and the recruiting scene is decent. I agree. But here're a few reasons why I left.

# Class Size

There were 250 kids in my introductory courses. They were weed-out classes so the size made sense. However,
there was usually a long line to get help on projects during office hour. As a new programmer, these time slots were crucial to
understand the assignments and reinforces the concepts in lectures. I usually came early to avoid the crowd and was able to get guidance on difficult projects. Those who came 30 minutes later were not so fortunate. With such big class size, it left fewer opportunities to ask questions during class since the professors need to go through lectures in a timely manner.

# Waitlisting

This is a problem with NYU CS as seen by Data Management and AIT with 120 on the waitlist by the end of the registration process for Spring 2021. However, it is also not a foreign [problem](https://dbknews.com/2017/12/11/umd-computer-science-petition-waitlists-iribe-differential-tuition-class-size/) to UMD. I suspect this also happens at other institutions recently as there is an increase in number of students majoring in CS. So it's unavoidable, especially with the more popular courses or professors. I recalled being on the waitlist for introductory courses at UMD until the last day of add/drop period before getting into it. Solving waitlisting is difficult as the demand for CS courses keeps going up but universities don't quite have the resources to hire more qualified faculty. One possible solution specific to NYU CS was outlined [here](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/12/08/waitlisted-professor-allocation.html) but I'm not sure if it's can be done anytime soon.

# Student Body

The student body at UMD certainly is stronger in term of programming ability. There is no doubt about that. However, as someone who was new
to programming and started in college, I noticed certain levels of cockiness, usually from those who learned programming in high school. I was intimidated to ask questions that might sound stupid to these students though those questions might be necessary to my understanding of the topic. Maybe I'm to blame for not being brave enough to ask them. But as someone who was new, it was difficult for me to break into the field with the gatekeepers.

I hope this doesn't come across as slandering UMD. I truly enjoyed my time at the school. I learned so much about computer science and built a solid foundation before transferring. I also found great friends and met brilliant TAs as well as inspiring professors. However, I wasn't
happy and decided to leave. By the time I left, I promised myself that I would make the most out of my CS education at NYU. So here're a few things I enjoy about NYU CS and how one can make the most out of your time here.

# Classes
The CS requirement courses at NYU are lackluster. It doesn't cover enough. Fortunately, the classes needed to cover the CS foundation are still available. A lot of students point out that the materials covered are not sufficient compared to other institution. However, if you choose the right professor, I believe the materials are quite on par and you will get the most out of it. Yes, yes, CS is difficult and sometimes you want to coast through certain classes. But if you are serious about your CS education, the only way is to put in the work and you will feel rewarding. As a CS student, here're my recommendations:
## Math
- Calculus I, II and III
- Discrete Math
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics OR Theory of Probability and Statistics

## Computer Science
- Introductory course
- [Data Structures - Joanna Klukowska](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs102_f20/)
- [Computer Systems - Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/fa18-cso/)
- [Basic Algorithms - Victor Shoup](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall20/CSCI-UA.0310-001/)
- [Programming Languages - Edward Yang](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0490-001/) OR the graduate version
- [Operating System - Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/classes/20sp/)

These courses are collected from my friends and I. I hope this doesn't steer you away from these professors. Rather, I hope to have you seek them out during registration process. I hope one day to see professor Shoup's Basic Algorithm course having a waitlist before other sections. [^0] 

[^0]: There are other ones such as Theory of Computing, Numerical Computing, Abstract Algebra (recommended by professor [Shoup](https://www.shoup.net/)) and others that cover more ground but the list above is good enough to hit the ground running for your CS education.

# Recruiting

NYU CS recruiting is not great. However, unless you are at MIT, CMU or other top CS programs, it requires lots of hutsle on your own[^1]. Torch has great posts about this, more specifically [do side project](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/21/side-projects.html), [read up about programming](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/02/10/how-much-do-you-read.html), [getting experience](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/01/02/first-job.html), and [apply to more than 10 postings](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/07/01/my-internships.html)!!! Luck is also at play here. It took me 350 applications for a sophomore internship and 200 for a junior internship. My friend, on the other hand, got a handful of interviews after only 50 applications. So it really depends on your situations so keep applying until you get an offer.

[^1]: Interestingly enough, I got an interview at Microsoft through NYU and also an internship offer from a hedge fund through Wasserman.

Additionally, there are great projects developed by NYU student with medium-sized codebase you can work on such as [Schedge](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/schedge). And tons of other open source projects in your favorite programming languages on GitHub. They are great entry points to software development. You can learn a great deal just by contributing and asking questions.

Another tip is to network, network and network. Send [cold email](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/19/sent-from-my-iphone.html) and talk to alumni/recruiters. Express your goal and learn about the company[^2].

[^2]: This is quite easy in the time of remote work. Just send emails for coffee chats or ask recruiters for internship openings.

So code, learn, apply and do your best! NYU CS might not have the greatest recruiting scene but that doesn't mean you can't succeeed!

# Final Thoughts
If you walk away believing that NYU CS is fine without any second thoughts about the criticisms, I am sorry but you are too complacent. NYU CS needs improvement and there is no doubt about that. The department needs the support from CAS, Courant, the faculty and the alumni, especially during time of COVID.

If you are at NYU and disappointed after reading reddit blogs or previous blogs, I hope this provides a way to take advantage of all the courses and resources at NYU. Rather than worrying about the environment, it might be more productive to make the best out of it and blame it after graduation.

Though I have my gripe with the CS department here and there, I'm generally happier at NYU. It's a combination of many factors. I enjoy meeting [Schedge creator](https://github.com/A1Liu), [Torch author](https://github.com/NicholasLYang) and [NYU CS Discord admin](https://github.com/esilverm). I enjoy going to [meetups in Microsoft Midtown Office](https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/). I enjoy having a diverse student body both in terms of race and geographic. I enjoy the ability to take walks in Manhattan and searching for cheap eats in Chinatown. NYU CS is not perfect by any means but there are reasons other than the courses you should consider before choosing a school. [^3]

[^3]: The biggest one is financial reason. Don't get into debts for college!!!
