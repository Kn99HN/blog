NYU CS needs work. Browsing recent reddit posts or Discord messages,
much of the writing about NYU CS CAS consists of criticisms. Most are
valid. This won't be a post filled with positives to raise your
expectation of NYU CS. Before reading this, I would suggest reading
[this
post](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/11/12/goto-nyu-cs-considered-harmful.html)
first and keeping it in mind.

I transferred from University of Maryland, College Park to NYU. Hence,
I would like to provide my perspective as a transfer student and
someone who started programming in college.

Many who are familiar with both CS departments would wonder "Why the hell did you transfer?". On paper,
UMD CS is a lot stronger. The [courses](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/search?courseId=CMSC&sectionId=&termId=202101&_openSectionsOnly=on&creditCompare=&credits=&courseLevelFilter=ALL&instructor=&_facetoface=on&_blended=on&_online=on&courseStartCompare=&courseStartHour=&courseStartMin=&courseStartAM=&courseEndHour=&courseEndMin=&courseEndAM=&teachingCenter=ALL&_classDay1=on&_classDay2=on&_classDay3=on&_classDay4=on&_classDay5=on) offered are more abundant and interesting. The student body has a stronger
programming skills and the recruiting scene is decent. I agree. But here's a few reasons why I left.

# Class Size

There are 250 kids in my introductory courses. They are weed-out
classes so the size makes sense. However, it left less room for help
from TA and professor. Usually, there's a long line to get help on
projects. Luckily, I usually came super early to avoid the crowds and
was able to get help on difficult projects. Students who came 30 minutes
later were not so fortunate. Additionally, it left less room to ask
questions during class as the professor needed to go through lectures
with 250 people in the lecture hall.

# Waitlisting

This is a common problem with NYU CS as seen by Data Management and AIT with 120 on the waitlist. However, it is also not a
foreign [problem](https://dbknews.com/2017/12/11/umd-computer-science-petition-waitlists-iribe-differential-tuition-class-size/) to UMD.
I suspect this is also commmon to other institutions recently as there is a rise in popularity of CS major. So it's not avoidable especially
with the more popular course or professor. I recall being on the waitlist for introductory course until the last day of the break before getting into it.

# Student Body

The student body at UMD certainly is stronger in term of programming ability. There is no doubt about that. However, as someone who is new
to programming and started learning in college, I notice certain levels of cockiness, usually from those who have taken programming
in high school. I was intimidated to ask questions that might sound stupid to these students though those questions might be fundamental
ones to my understanding of the topic. Maybe I'm to blame for it for not be brave and asking those questions. But as someone who is new,
it was difficult for me to break into the field with such gatekeeping.

I hope this doesn't come across as slandering UMD. I truly enjoy my time at the school. I learned so much about computer science and build a solid foundation before transferring. I also found great friends and meet brilliant TAs as well as inspiring professors. However, I wasn't
happy at the school and decided to leave. So, I ensure I made the most out of my education at NYU CS given my knowledge of the courses at UMD. So here's a few things I enjoy about NYU CS and how one can make the most out of the department.

# Classes
The CS requirement courses at NYU are lackluster. It doesn't cover enough. Fortunately, the classes needed to cover the foundation are still available. A lot of students point out that the materials covered are not sufficient compared to other institution. However, if you choose the right professor, I believe the materials are quite on par and you will get the most out of it. Yes, yes, CS is difficult and sometimes you want to coast through certain classes. However, if you are serious about your CS education, only way is to put in the work and you will feel rewarding. As a CS student, here's my recommendations to cover the fundamentals:
## Math
- Calculus I, II and III
- Discrete Math
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics OR Theory of Probability and Statistics

## Computer Science
- Introductory course
- [Data Structures - Joanna Klukowska](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs102_f20/)
- [Computer Systems - Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/fa18-cso/)
- [Basic Algorithms - Victor Shoup](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall20/CSCI-UA.0310-001/)
- [Programming Languages - Edward Yang](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0490-001/) OR the graduate version
- [Operating System - Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/classes/20sp/)

These are the collective list from my experience and friend's. I don't have any suggestions for mathematics professors but generally the Courant instructors are all great and brilliant. I hope this doesn't steer you away from these professors. Rather, I hope to have you seek them out during registration process.

# Recruiting
A criticism about NYU CS recruiting is not great. I agree. However, unless you are at MIT or CMU, it requires hutsle on your own[^0]. Torch has great posts about this, more specifically [do side project](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/21/side-projects.html), [read up about programming](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/02/10/how-much-do-you-read.html), [getting experience](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/01/02/first-job.html), and [apply to more than 10 postings](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/07/01/my-internships.html)!!!

[^0]: Interestingly enough, I got an interview at Microsoft through NYU and also an internship offer from a hedge fund through Wasserman.

Additionally, there are great projects developed by NYU student with medium-sized codebase you can work on such as [Schedge](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/schedge). And tons of other open source projects in your favorite programming languages. They are great entry to software development.

Another tip is network, network and network. Send [cold email](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2019/12/19/sent-from-my-iphone.html) and talk to alumni/recruiters. Express your goal and learn about the company[^1].

[^1]: This is quite easy in the time of remote work. It'll be more detailed in a later post.

So code, learn, apply and do your best! NYU CS might not have the greatest recruiting scene but that doesn't mean you can't succeeed!

# Final Thoughts
If you walk away believing that NYU CS is fine without any second thoughts about the criticisms, I am sorry but you are complacent. NYU CS needs improvement and there is no doubt about that. The department needs the support from CAS, Courant, the faculty and the alumni, especially during time of COVID.

If you are at NYU and disappointed after reading reddit blogs or previous blogs, I hope this provide you a solution to take advantage of all the courses and resources at NYU. Rather than worrying about the environment, it's better to make your best out of it and blame it after graduation.

I'm happy at NYU. It's a combination of many factors. I enjoy meeting [Schedge creator](https://github.com/A1Liu), [Torch author](https://github.com/NicholasLYang) and [NYU CS Discord admin](https://github.com/esilverm). I enjoy going to [meetups in Microsoft Midtown Office](https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/). I enjoy having a diverse student body both in terms of race and geographic. I enjoy the ability to take walks in Manhattan and searching for cheap eats in Chinatown. NYU CS is not perfect by any means but there are reasons other than the courses you should consider before choosing a school.
