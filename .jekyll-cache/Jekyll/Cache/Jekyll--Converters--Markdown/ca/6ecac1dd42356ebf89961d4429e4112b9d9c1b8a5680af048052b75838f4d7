I"ÒC<p>Getting stuck sucks. There‚Äôs no way around it. Whether it‚Äôs not being
able to find the missing semicolon or having trouble understanding
this new library, being stuck is one of the most frustrating parts of
programming. That being said, it‚Äôs also one of the most important
aspects of programming. A programmer who can surmount these roadblocks
is worth their weight in gold.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found that students don‚Äôt always know how to get unstuck. Which
is understandable; getting unstuck isn‚Äôt a skill taught in a lot of CS
programs. But here‚Äôs your chance to prevent that. I‚Äôm going to provide
4 levels of getting stuck, from basic to advanced, then methods for
getting unstuck. Some of these levels you may already know how to
tackle. Others you may not.</p>

<h1 id="level-0-my-code-wont-compile">Level 0: My Code Won‚Äôt Compile!</h1>

<p>This is the lowest, and most common way people get stuck. Their code
doesn‚Äôt compile or something small doesn‚Äôt work, say a wrong output or
an unexpected segfault/exception. Basically the issue is at the level
of code execution, not conceptual or theoretical.</p>

<p>Generally people have decent strategies for this level. If your code
doesn‚Äôt compile, generally the compiler will have some decent error
messages which can help you. I often comment out code and see if the
compiler error goes away.</p>

<p>For runtime errors, Some people use debuggers like gdb (which are
actually a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PorfLSr3DDI">lot cooler</a>
than your CSO prof made them out to be!). Others, like myself, use
print statements. Print statements are nice because they allow you to
see the flow of your code, even in languages like C that don‚Äôt have
exceptions. I use numbers a lot of the time so that you can see when
the code halts:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>char* file_content = read_file();
printf("1\n");
char* first_entry = get_first_entry(file_content);
printf("2\n");
int first_number = parse_int(first_entry);
printf("3\n");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the output is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1
2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you know that the bug is probably in <code class="highlighter-rouge">parse_int</code>.</p>

<p>Another good strategy to learn is to write small tests. In some
languages you‚Äôre lucky enough to have a REPL or Read Eval Print
Loop. That‚Äôs the prompt that pops up when you type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code> to your
Terminal. REPLs are great ways to test out small assumptions. For
instance, say I forgot how to get the length of an array in Python</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr.length
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'length'
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr.len
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'len'
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(arr)
3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And hey, cool! Now I remember.</p>

<p>For languages that don‚Äôt have REPLs, like C, you can write a small
program and check. I have a folder called scratch on my computer where
I test out small programs.</p>

<p>For instance, my <code class="highlighter-rouge">scratch.c</code> file currently has a small program
testing out how to read items from a directory in C. When I was
writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> for my Operating Systems course, I wasn‚Äôt super clear on
how that worked. Instead of blindly forging ahead and trying to get
the code right in the context of the complicated lab code, I decided
to just write a small test that read from a directory. That way I was
able to understand that code in isolation before applying it to the
larger context of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>.</p>

<p>And sure, you can always look up the answers to these small questions
on StackOverflow, but there‚Äôs something to be said about testing your
hypotheses. For one, if you‚Äôre ever without an internet connection and
writing code, you‚Äôll be able to make progress. Second, you‚Äôll be able
to reason through your code a little better. If someone asks you a
question, instead of just directing them to StackOverflow, you can
write a little test and find out. Plus typing a few lines in a REPL
takes less time than searching on Google, finding a StackOverflow
answer and reading it.</p>

<h1 id="level-1-i-dont-understand-this-error">Level 1: I Don‚Äôt Understand This Error</h1>

<p>The next level can be described as basic conceptual problems. For
instance, say you need to read a file into memory with Python. Where
would you go to learn such a thing? Who you gonna call? StackOverflow!</p>

<p>Ah StackOverflow. The most worshiped of programming sites. And for
good reasons. It‚Äôs an incredibly useful site. Most people restrict
themselves to just reading it, so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll discuss for this
level.</p>

<p>When reading a StackOverflow post, it‚Äôs important to keep a mental
checklist. Here‚Äôs what I keep on my checklist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this solution up to date?</li>
  <li>Does this solution actually solve my problem?</li>
  <li>Is there some specific precondition in this question that doesn‚Äôt apply to me?</li>
  <li>Why might I not want to use this solution?</li>
</ul>

<p>To give an example, let‚Äôs walk through a simple question. You have an
array of values in JavaScript. You want to check if a value is in the
array. Google around, you find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181575/determine-whether-an-array-contains-a-value">this
post</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the first answer, we see this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/stackoverflow-answer-01.png" alt="A StackOverflow answer that implements a custom contains function written in 2009" width="600" /></p>

<p>Going through our checklist, we notice that the answer is
from 2009. Sure, there‚Äôs been some edits since then, but the core code
is still over 10 years old. Hmm, maybe that‚Äôs not the best option.</p>

<p>In fact, most of these answers are 10 years old. So maybe this isn‚Äôt
the best post. Let‚Äôs go to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-a-value-in-javascript">another
post</a>. Reading
the first answer, we see:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/stackoverflow-answer-02.png" alt="A much better StackOverflow answer with up to date solutions using Array#includes" width="600" /></p>

<p>This is pretty good! The answer was last updated in November of this
year, there‚Äôs a few different options given and the post has plenty of
upvotes so people have found it useful.</p>

<p>Reading the post, we notice that there‚Äôs a built in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Array#includes</code>
function that does exactly what we want. Great! This solution is up to
date, it solves our problem and it doesn‚Äôt have any unnecessary
preconditions.</p>

<p>But why might we not want to use this solution? If we read a little
further, we notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Array#includes</code> may not work for older
browsers. Depending on your situation, this might be true. Many
companies still support old browsers. If it is, then maybe we should
consider the other options given in the post, such as using
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Array#indexOf</code> or using a library. Of course, you should cross
reference each of these options in turn with the checklist.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs definitely other things you should add to your checklist such
as number of upvotes, comments, security concerns and even code
style. But that‚Äôll come with practice and experience.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been talking solely about StackOverflow, but there‚Äôs other
helpful resources, such as GitHub issues. GitHub issues are problems
opened on GitHub repositories for a given library or language. GitHub
issues are great for fixing problems with newish libraries or cutting
edge language features. For instance I use issues for problems with
front end libraries because front end development moves so quickly
that the likelihood I‚Äôll get a good, up to date answer on
StackOverflow is next to nil. Likewise, if I were using Rust‚Äôs nightly
language builds and ran into a weird error, I might look on Rust‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues">GitHub issues page</a>.</p>

<p>One quick tip is to search through closed issues as well. Often these
will have your solution.</p>

<p>Of course sometimes you run into an issue with what appears to be five
million comments, ending with ‚Äúany updates on this issue?‚Äù (*cough*
<a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/19">Rocket</a>
*cough*). That sucks.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs other niche sites that are useful. For instance, Server Fault
for system administrator problems, Emacs StackOverflow for emacs
issues, and on occasion Reddit can be useful.</p>

<p>Please don‚Äôt copy code directly from StackOverflow. For one, it‚Äôs lazy
and doesn‚Äôt teach you anything. Typing out code forces you to go
through it word by word (or lexeme by lexeme I suppose). You can learn
a surprising amount by just transcribing. Also the naming and overall
structure of a snippet might not work with your existing code. If a
snippet uses a <code class="highlighter-rouge">names</code> variable when you‚Äôre dealing with colors, it‚Äôll
be super confusing for any future developers.</p>

<h1 id="level-15-this-answer-doesnt-entirely-work">Level 1.5: This Answer Doesn‚Äôt Entirely Work</h1>

<p>Unfortunately it‚Äôs all too common that a StackOverFlow answer doesn‚Äôt
work completely. Unless you happen to stumble upon a post that exactly
gives you the answer to your specific question, you‚Äôll probably end up
in a situation where one post on SO will give you 40% of the answer
and another post will give you another 30% and you have to kinda futz
the last 30%. You can and should get good at futzing. Futzing
basically means making leaps of logic and trying different
approaches. This is where version control comes in handy. You can
commit your existing code, try a new approach, then roll it back if it
doesn‚Äôt work.</p>

<p>Common techniques in futzing include using different package versions,
rewriting part of the code, and going back to Level 0 or local
debugging.</p>

<h1 id="level-2-my-question-isnt-on-stackoverflow">Level 2: My Question Isn‚Äôt On StackOverflow</h1>

<p>This is the big jump. This is what separates the children from the
adults. If you dare to dip your toe into the vast, sometimes
intimidating pool of knowledge that is StackOverflow and ask a
question, you can reap some immense rewards.</p>

<p>StackOverflow has a reputation of being prickly and unfriendly. And
sometimes that can be the case. But it‚Äôs a little undeserved in my
opinion. If you follow the tenants of writing a good question, then
you won‚Äôt face the wrath of StackOverflow. SO includes a great
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">guide</a> on writing a
question. But really, it boils down to doing your due diligence in
researching the topic and exhausting all possibilities before
posting. Jon Skeet, one of the most legendary StackOverflow question
answerers (over a million reputation points), has a
<a href="https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/">post</a>
as well.</p>

<p>However if you do face some resistance or snark, it is good to push
back, albeit gently and politely. A comment noting why your answer is
not a duplicate or describing the problem in more detail will notify
the responders that maybe they should take a second look.</p>

<p>In general it helps to be polite. You may be panicking and stressed
and under a deadline, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should be rude. I try
to always end the question with a thank you and my name. It may seem
overly polite or formal but I hope it endears me to anybody reading
the question.</p>

<p>GitHub issues are great place to ask as well. Again, GitHub issues are
more for cutting edge problems or specific libraries. Sometimes the
project will have a template to fill out. These are great and you
should do your best to follow it as closely as possible.</p>

<p>Sometimes I use GitHub issues if I‚Äôm trying to accomplish something
but the documentation isn‚Äôt up to par. Even though it‚Äôs not
technically a bug in the code, it‚Äôs a bug in their
documentation. Which is equally important.</p>

<h1 id="level-3-how-the-fk-does-this-library-work">Level 3: How The F%$K Does This Library Work?</h1>

<p>Ah yes, you‚Äôve decided to use a library or maybe another codebase and
the genius authors left no goddamn documentation. You need to figure
out how it works before the assignment deadline/end of the
sprint/bombs explode. This is where it gets real. This is where you
need to learn how to read code.</p>

<p>Reading code isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs incredibly rewarding. It‚Äôs much much
harder than writing code and equally as important.  Much like how
reading good prose helps you write good prose, reading good code helps
you write better code. And reading bad code can help you understand
what not to do. I‚Äôll probably write a full post about this, since
there‚Äôs a few strategies I‚Äôve picked up over the years.</p>

<p>If I had to give a crash course on reading the source, I‚Äôd start by
recommending that you clone the source code from GitHub or wherever
it‚Äôs stored.  Then use something like
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> to search through the
code and something like <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> or
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html">find</a> to search
through files. A good IDE can also do wonders. VSCode isn‚Äôt
technically an IDE but because of language servers, it works as one. I
also love JetBrains IDEs, which you get free with your NYU email. I
use WebStorm for web dev and Intellij for Java/Rust development. You
can also take notes on the codebase, either on paper or on the
computer. I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode</a> with urls, but that‚Äôs
a little involved.</p>

<p>A great way to learn more is to build the code and play around with
it. Try to tweak functions or add print statements. You can learn a
lot that way.</p>

<p>This is a level that most people don‚Äôt even think to tackle. I myself
only started to read other people‚Äôs codebases to solve my bugs within
the last year or two (I credit a <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/joe-armstrong.html">wonderful
interview</a> of Joe
Armstrong, the creator of Erlang for the inspiration). But when you
think about it, the source code is the only truly accurate and up to
date documentation. Plus once you learn to read code, not a lot can
stop you. Any library can be adopted. Any bug can be pinpointed with
enough code reading.</p>

<p>Plus there‚Äôs nothing better than opening a GitHub issue that provides
the exact issue with line numbers and everything. The maintainer will
probably like that a lot more than a ‚Äúhelp my code doesnt work!!!‚Äù.</p>

<h1 id="level-4-this-librarycompilertool-is-broken">Level 4: This Library/Compiler/Tool Is Broken</h1>

<p>You‚Äôve gone through level 3 and read the damn code. But wait! You‚Äôve
realized that there‚Äôs a bug. What do you do? Fix it!</p>

<p>This is the truly enlightened approach. Have a problem with a library?
Fix it your damn self! Not only will you fix your problem, you‚Äôll get
some open source street cred. There‚Äôs nothing like saying you‚Äôve
contributed to the TypeScript language or the Postgres database, or
whatever.</p>

<p>Again, this isn‚Äôt easy. But getting used to reading and eventually
contributing to massive codebases is an extremely valuable skill. A
lot of work in a large tech company is precisely that. If you can
learn these skills now, you‚Äôll be well prepared for working in the
industry.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to an open source project, reach out to the
maintainer and ask for some help. They‚Äôll generally be
accomodating‚Äîafter all who would turn down free labor? Try to
pick a simple task. Don‚Äôt attempt a major feature on your first try.</p>

<p>Once you have a task, find the minimal amount you need to learn of the
codebase to make some progress. Try tweaking a little bit of code,
then compiling/building and seeing what happens. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go
back to the maintainer and ask for help.</p>

<h1 id="other">Other</h1>

<p>There‚Äôs certainly a lot more ways you can get stuck, but I believe
that these five (and a half) ways are the main tiers. I‚Äôd say an
average CS student can handle levels 0 and 1, a good CS student can
tackle 0, 1, 1.5 and maybe 2. A solid programmer can definitely handle
level 3 and a fairly good programmer can do 4. Truly top tier
programmers can take level 4 to the next level and build
libraries/languages/tools that solve their problems. If you can do
that, then truly nothing can stop you.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt expect everybody to get to the top levels immediately, but if
you can jump up a level, it‚Äôll make a huge difference in terms of how
you approach programming and what you can accomplish on a daily basis.</p>
